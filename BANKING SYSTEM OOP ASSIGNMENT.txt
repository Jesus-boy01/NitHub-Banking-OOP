BANKING SYSTEM OOP ASSIGNMENT 
RESEARCH HOW YOU'LL RUN AND USE TYPESCRIPT IN YOUR PROJECT 

BANK SYSTEM CLASS 
SHOULD HAVE DEFAULT BANK NAME

NOTE: REMOVE THE ACCOUNT PIN FROM VIEW

FOR THE TRANSFER, THE USER ACCOUNT SHOULD HAVE AMOUNT AND ACCOUNT TO SEND TO AS PARAMETERS, 
IF THERE IS A WAY TO CHECK IF THE BANK EXISTS(CAN IMPLEMENT THIS BY CHECKING IF THE ACCOUNT NUMBER 
EXISTS FROM THE BANKING SYSTEM CLASS), DO THAT AND THEN USE THE WITHDRAW METHOD ON THE ACCOUNT:
AND THE DEPOSIT METHOS ON THE RECEIVING BANK
